# Appendix C. Weighted contingency-test outputs (design-based)

This appendix lists the full output tables corresponding to the design-based contingency tests referenced in the Results.

**Primary operationalization (social = co-offending + observed; reported as social vs solo, with component breakdown available):**

- **Table C1 (Total incidents):** Weighted distribution table and associated design-based contingency output (omnibus + Bonferroni-adjusted pairwise)
  - `total/weighted/R_Tables/combinedco-ncvs_percentages_table.docx`
  - `total/weighted/R_Tables/combinedco-chi_squared_table.docx`

- **Table C2 (Theft incidents):** Weighted distribution table and associated design-based contingency output (omnibus + Bonferroni-adjusted pairwise)
  - `total/weighted/Theft_R_Tables/combinedco-ncvs_percentages_table.docx`
  - `total/weighted/Theft_R_Tables/combinedco-chi_squared_table.docx`

- **Table C3 (Violent incidents):** Weighted distribution table and associated design-based contingency output (omnibus + Bonferroni-adjusted pairwise)
  - `total/weighted/Violent_R_Tables/combinedco-ncvs_percentages_table.docx`
  - `total/weighted/Violent_R_Tables/combinedco-chi_squared_table.docx`

**Backup operationalization (co-offending only; observed removed; non-co-offending treated as solo):**

- **Table C4 (Total incidents, backup):**
  - `total/weighted/R_Tables_backup/backup_percentages_alone_group.docx`
  - `total/weighted/R_Tables_backup/backup_rao_scott_chi_square.docx`

Notes:
- These `.docx` tables are generated by the Rmd scoring pipelines in `total/weighted/` and represent the full numeric output referenced in the narrative Results.
