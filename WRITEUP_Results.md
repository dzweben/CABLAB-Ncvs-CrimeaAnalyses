## Total incidents (primary definition: alone vs. group vs. observed)

### Descriptive patterns across age groups
Across the total incident sample, the distribution of incident social context varied meaningfully by age group. In the adolescent and emerging-adult ranges, **group offending constituted roughly one-third of incidents** (15–17: **32.6%**; 18–20: **33.2%**), whereas it was lower in early adolescence (12–14: **24.8%**) and declined further in adulthood (21–29: **21.1%**; 30+: **12.0%**). Conversely, the proportion of incidents categorized as **alone** increased steadily from adolescence into adulthood (e.g., 15–17: **42.7%**; 18–20: **46.4%**; 21–29: **57.3%**; 30+: **64.7%**). The **observed** category varied across age (e.g., 12–14: **32.2%**; 18–20: **20.4%**; 30+: **23.2%**).

### Design-based tests and pairwise comparisons
Design-based omnibus tests indicated that age group was associated with the distribution of social context (Rao–Scott adjusted test reported as **F**), and pairwise comparisons showed the clearest differences between adolescent/emerging-adult groups and older adult groups. After Bonferroni adjustment, contrasts involving **30+** versus each younger age group were consistently statistically significant (all adjusted ps < .001), reflecting the substantially higher prevalence of solo offending in older adulthood.

### Logistic regression: likelihood of solo offending
Survey-weighted logistic regression models further quantified the magnitude of age differences in solo offending. Using **15–17** as the reference category, odds of solo offending were higher for adults (21–29: **OR = 1.80**, 95% CI [1.56, 2.08]; 30+: **OR = 2.46**, 95% CI [2.11, 2.87]), whereas differences between adjacent adolescent/emerging-adult categories were comparatively smaller (e.g., 18–20 vs. 15–17: **OR = 1.16**, 95% CI [0.98, 1.37]).

Using **18–20** as the reference category, 15–17 did not differ meaningfully in the odds of solo offending (15–17 vs. 18–20: **OR = 0.86**, 95% CI [0.73, 1.02]), whereas adult groups again showed substantially higher odds (21–29: **OR = 1.55**, 95% CI [1.38, 1.74]; 30+: **OR = 2.12**, 95% CI [1.87, 2.40]).

## Theft incidents

### Descriptive patterns across age groups
In the theft-only scope, group offending again peaked in adolescence and early emerging adulthood, with group incidents comprising **34.3%** (15–17) and **33.2%** (18–20) of theft incidents. Group offending was lower in 12–14 (**31.6%**) and declined in adulthood (21–29: **24.1%**; 30+: **17.4%**). Solo theft increased with age (15–17: **44.8%**; 18–20: **46.1%**; 21–29: **52.7%**; 30+: **60.6%**).

## Violent incidents

### Descriptive patterns across age groups
In the violent-only scope, the age pattern was similar but more pronounced: group offending constituted **32.0%** (15–17) and **33.2%** (18–20) of violent incidents, compared with **23.5%** in 12–14 and **10.7%** in 30+. Solo violence increased sharply in adulthood (21–29: **59.0%**; 30+: **65.8%**), while observed violence was highest in early adolescence (12–14: **33.5%**).

## Backup analysis: total incidents with “social = co-offending only”

When “social” was defined strictly as co-offending (group) rather than including the observed category, the substantive age pattern persisted. Under this backup definition, group offending was highest in **15–17 (31.78%)** and **18–20 (32.41%)**, intermediate in **Under 12 (27.14%)** and **12–14 (24.72%)**, and lowest in adulthood (21–29: **20.21%**; 30+: **12.05%**). This robustness check indicates that the adolescent/emerging-adult elevation in group offending is not an artifact of classifying observation/witnessing as “social.”

## Supplemental (unweighted) robustness checks

Unweighted supplemental analyses (standard chi-square tests and standard logistic regressions) were consistent with the primary weighted analyses in the **direction and overall pattern** of results across total, theft, violent, and backup operationalizations, supporting the robustness of the substantive findings to the weighting and variance-estimation framework.
