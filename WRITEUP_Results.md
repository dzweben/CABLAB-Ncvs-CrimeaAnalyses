## Total incidents (primary definition: solo vs. social; social = co-offending + observed)

### Descriptive patterns across age groups
Across the total incident sample, the proportion of incidents classified as **social** (co-offending + observed) varied meaningfully by age group. Social incidents were most common in the youngest and adolescent age ranges and remained elevated into early emerging adulthood (e.g., Under 12: **52.5%**; 12–14: **57.0%**; 15–17: **57.3%**; 18–20: **53.6%**), before declining in adulthood (21–29: **42.6%**; 30+: **35.2%**). Conversely, the proportion categorized as **solo** increased steadily from adolescence into adulthood (e.g., 15–17: **42.7%**; 18–20: **46.4%**; 21–29: **57.3%**; 30+: **64.7%**).

Within the social category, **co-offending** constituted roughly one-third of incidents in adolescence and early emerging adulthood (15–17: **32.6%**; 18–20: **33.2%**) and declined in adulthood (21–29: **21.1%**; 30+: **12.0%**), whereas the **observed** component varied across age (e.g., 12–14: **32.2%**; 18–20: **20.4%**; 30+: **23.2%**).

### Design-based tests and pairwise comparisons
A design-based omnibus test indicated that age group was associated with the distribution of social context (Rao–Scott adjusted **F**(4.50) = **108.08**, p < .001). To emphasize effect magnitudes, the largest descriptive contrasts in **social** involvement were between older adulthood and the adolescent/emerging-adult groups (e.g., **Δsocial = 22.1 percentage points** for 15–17 vs. 30+; 57.3% vs. 35.2%).

Pairwise comparisons (Bonferroni-adjusted) showed especially large differences between older adulthood (30+) and each younger group (all adjusted ps < .001). In contrast, several comparisons within the youngest and adjacent adolescent/emerging-adult groups were not statistically distinguishable after Bonferroni adjustment (e.g., 15–17 vs. 18–20: adjusted p = 1.00; Under 12 vs. 12–14: adjusted p = 1.00), consistent with the comparatively similar distributions in those adjacent age ranges. Full design-based contingency output and pairwise tests are provided in Appendix C (Table C1).

### Logistic regression: likelihood of solo offending
Survey-weighted logistic regression models further quantified the magnitude of age differences in solo offending. Using **15–17** as the reference category, odds of solo offending were higher for adults (21–29: **OR = 1.80**, 95% CI [1.56, 2.08], p < .001; 30+: **OR = 2.46**, 95% CI [2.11, 2.87], p < .001), whereas differences between adjacent adolescent/emerging-adult categories were comparatively small (18–20 vs. 15–17: **OR = 1.16**, 95% CI [0.98, 1.37], p = .08).

Using **18–20** as the reference category, 15–17 did not differ meaningfully in the odds of solo offending (15–17 vs. 18–20: **OR = 0.86**, 95% CI [0.73, 1.02], p = .08), whereas adult groups again showed substantially higher odds (21–29: **OR = 1.55**, 95% CI [1.38, 1.74], p < .001; 30+: **OR = 2.12**, 95% CI [1.87, 2.40], p < .001).

Notably, the 18–20 and 15–17 comparisons were similar in magnitude and not statistically distinguishable at α = .05 in these models (both ps = .08), consistent with the descriptive pattern that social context peaks in mid-adolescence and remains elevated into ages 18–20 before declining in older adulthood.

## Theft incidents (primary definition: solo vs. social; social = co-offending + observed)

### Descriptive patterns across age groups
In the theft-only scope, the primary contrast of interest was **solo vs. social** theft (social = co-offending + observed). Social theft remained elevated across early adolescence through emerging adulthood (e.g., 12–14: **57.7%**; 15–17: **55.2%**; 18–20: **53.9%**) and declined in adulthood (21–29: **47.3%**; 30+: **39.4%**). Conversely, solo theft increased with age (15–17: **44.8%**; 18–20: **46.1%**; 21–29: **52.7%**; 30+: **60.6%**).

Within the social theft category, co-offending comprised about one-third of theft incidents in adolescence and early emerging adulthood (15–17: **34.3%**; 18–20: **33.2%**) and declined in adulthood (21–29: **24.1%**; 30+: **17.4%**), with the observed component accounting for the remaining social portion.

### Design-based tests and logistic regression
A design-based omnibus test indicated age differences in theft social context (Rao–Scott adjusted **F**(4.59) = **29.00**, p < .001). In effect-size terms, theft showed sizable social-versus-solo differences when comparing adolescence to older adulthood (e.g., **Δsocial = 15.8 percentage points** for 15–17 vs. 30+; 55.2% vs. 39.4%).

Bonferroni-adjusted pairwise comparisons showed that differences were primarily driven by contrasts involving older adulthood (e.g., 15–17 vs. 30+: adjusted p < .001; 18–20 vs. 30+: adjusted p < .001), whereas comparisons among adjacent adolescent/emerging-adult groups were not distinguishable after correction (e.g., 15–17 vs. 18–20: adjusted p = 1.00). Full design-based contingency output is provided in Appendix C (Table C2).

Survey-weighted logistic models told the same story in effect-size terms. Using **15–17** as the reference, odds of solo theft were higher in adulthood (21–29: **OR = 1.37**, 95% CI [1.10, 1.72], p = .01; 30+: **OR = 1.90**, 95% CI [1.50, 2.41], p < .001), while differences between 18–20 and 15–17 were small (18–20 vs. 15–17: **OR = 1.05**, 95% CI [0.82, 1.34], p = .68). Using **18–20** as the reference, 15–17 remained similar (15–17 vs. 18–20: **OR = 0.95**, 95% CI [0.75, 1.21], p = .68), and adult groups again showed higher odds of solo offending (21–29: **OR = 1.31**, 95% CI [1.08, 1.57], p = .01; 30+: **OR = 1.80**, 95% CI [1.52, 2.14], p < .001).

## Violent incidents (primary definition: solo vs. social; social = co-offending + observed)

### Descriptive patterns across age groups
In the violent-only scope, the primary contrast of interest was **solo vs. social** violence (social = co-offending + observed). Social violence remained high across early adolescence through emerging adulthood (e.g., Under 12: **52.6%**; 12–14: **57.0%**; 15–17: **58.0%**; 18–20: **53.4%**) and then declined sharply in adulthood (21–29: **40.9%**; 30+: **34.2%**). Conversely, solo violence increased sharply in adulthood (21–29: **59.0%**; 30+: **65.8%**).

Within the social violence category, co-offending accounted for about one-third of violent incidents in mid-adolescence and emerging adulthood (15–17: **32.0%**; 18–20: **33.2%**) and was lower in early adolescence (12–14: **23.5%**) and older adulthood (30+: **10.7%**). The observed component was especially prominent in early adolescence (12–14: **33.5%**).

### Design-based tests and logistic regression
A design-based omnibus test indicated age differences in violent-incident social context (Rao–Scott adjusted **F**(4.46) = **83.88**, p < .001). Effect-size differences were particularly large for violence when comparing adolescence to older adulthood (e.g., **Δsocial = 23.8 percentage points** for 15–17 vs. 30+; 58.0% vs. 34.2%).

Pairwise contrasts again showed especially strong differences between 30+ and younger groups (all adjusted ps < .001), while 15–17 and 18–20 were not distinguishable after correction (adjusted p = 1.00). Full design-based contingency output is provided in Appendix C (Table C3).

In survey-weighted logistic models with **15–17** as the reference category, odds of solo offending were substantially higher in adulthood (21–29: **OR = 1.99**, 95% CI [1.64, 2.40], p < .001; 30+: **OR = 2.65**, 95% CI [2.20, 3.20], p < .001), whereas 18–20 was similar to 15–17 (18–20 vs. 15–17: **OR = 1.20**, 95% CI [0.97, 1.49], p = .09). With **18–20** as the reference, 15–17 again showed similar odds (15–17 vs. 18–20: **OR = 0.83**, 95% CI [0.67, 1.03], p = .09), while adult groups had higher odds (21–29: **OR = 1.65**, 95% CI [1.42, 1.92], p < .001; 30+: **OR = 2.20**, 95% CI [1.88, 2.59], p < .001).

## Backup analysis (co-offending only)

### Descriptive patterns
In a backup operationalization, we defined the social component strictly as **co-offending** (that is, we removed the observed category and treated all non-co-offending incidents as solo). Under this co-offending-only definition, co-offending was highest in **15–17 (31.78%)** and **18–20 (32.41%)**, intermediate in **Under 12 (27.14%)** and **12–14 (24.72%)**, and lowest in adulthood (21–29: **20.21%**; 30+: **12.05%**).

### Design-based test and logistic regression
A design-based omnibus test indicated that age group was associated with the co-offending-versus-solo distribution under this backup operationalization (Rao–Scott adjusted **F**(4.47) = **99.10**, p < .001).

In survey-weighted logistic models using **15–17** as the reference category, **18–20** again showed very similar odds of solo offending (18–20 vs. 15–17: **OR = 0.97**, 95% CI [0.82, 1.16], p = .74), whereas adult groups had substantially higher odds of solo offending (21–29: **OR = 1.84**, 95% CI [1.58, 2.13], p < .001; 30+: **OR = 3.40**, 95% CI [2.88, 4.02], p < .001). Using **18–20** as the reference category, 15–17 remained similar (15–17 vs. 18–20: **OR = 1.03**, 95% CI [0.87, 1.22], p = .74), while adult groups again had higher odds (21–29: **OR = 1.89**, 95% CI [1.61, 2.23], p < .001; 30+: **OR = 3.50**, 95% CI [3.02, 4.05], p < .001).

Together, these results indicate that the adolescent/emerging-adult elevation in co-offending is not an artifact of classifying observation/witnessing as part of the primary social-crime definition.

## Supplemental (unweighted) robustness checks

Unweighted supplemental analyses (standard chi-square tests and standard logistic regressions) were consistent with the primary weighted analyses in the **direction and overall pattern** of results across total, theft, violent, and the backup operationalization. Because the unweighted analytic sample is already large, these supplemental results underscore that the substantive conclusions are not dependent on the weighting/replicate-weight framework and that interpretation should remain centered on effect magnitudes and interval estimates rather than statistical significance alone. Full unweighted outputs are saved as bundled tables for each scope in `supplemental/unweighted_outputs/` (one `*_SUPPLEMENT_unweighted.docx` per scope).
