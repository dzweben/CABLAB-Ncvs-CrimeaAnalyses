## Total incidents (primary definition: alone vs. group vs. observed)

### Descriptive patterns across age groups
Across the total incident sample, the distribution of incident social context varied meaningfully by age group. In the adolescent and emerging-adult ranges, **group offending constituted roughly one-third of incidents** (15–17: **32.6%**; 18–20: **33.2%**), whereas it was lower in early adolescence (12–14: **24.8%**) and declined further in adulthood (21–29: **21.1%**; 30+: **12.0%**). Conversely, the proportion of incidents categorized as **alone** increased steadily from adolescence into adulthood (e.g., 15–17: **42.7%**; 18–20: **46.4%**; 21–29: **57.3%**; 30+: **64.7%**). The **observed** category varied across age (e.g., 12–14: **32.2%**; 18–20: **20.4%**; 30+: **23.2%**).

### Design-based tests and pairwise comparisons
A design-based omnibus test indicated that age group was associated with the distribution of social context (Rao–Scott adjusted **F = 108.08**, df = 4.50, p < .001). Pairwise comparisons (Bonferroni-adjusted) showed especially large differences between older adulthood (30+) and each younger group (all adjusted ps < .001). In contrast, several comparisons within the youngest and adjacent adolescent/emerging-adult groups were not statistically distinguishable after Bonferroni adjustment (e.g., 15–17 vs. 18–20: adjusted p = 1.00; Under 12 vs. 12–14: adjusted p = 1.00), consistent with the comparatively similar distributions in those adjacent age ranges.

### Logistic regression: likelihood of solo offending
Survey-weighted logistic regression models further quantified the magnitude of age differences in solo offending. Using **15–17** as the reference category, odds of solo offending were higher for adults (21–29: **OR = 1.80**, 95% CI [1.56, 2.08], p < .001; 30+: **OR = 2.46**, 95% CI [2.11, 2.87], p < .001), whereas differences between adjacent adolescent/emerging-adult categories were comparatively small (18–20 vs. 15–17: **OR = 1.16**, 95% CI [0.98, 1.37], p = .08).

Using **18–20** as the reference category, 15–17 did not differ meaningfully in the odds of solo offending (15–17 vs. 18–20: **OR = 0.86**, 95% CI [0.73, 1.02], p = .08), whereas adult groups again showed substantially higher odds (21–29: **OR = 1.55**, 95% CI [1.38, 1.74], p < .001; 30+: **OR = 2.12**, 95% CI [1.87, 2.40], p < .001).

## Theft incidents

### Descriptive patterns across age groups
In the theft-only scope, group offending again peaked in adolescence and early emerging adulthood, with group incidents comprising **34.3%** (15–17) and **33.2%** (18–20) of theft incidents. Group offending declined in adulthood (21–29: **24.1%**; 30+: **17.4%**), whereas solo theft increased with age (15–17: **44.8%**; 18–20: **46.1%**; 21–29: **52.7%**; 30+: **60.6%**).

### Design-based tests and logistic regression
A design-based omnibus test indicated age differences in theft social context (Rao–Scott adjusted **F = 29.00**, df = 4.59, p < .001). Bonferroni-adjusted pairwise comparisons showed that differences were primarily driven by contrasts involving older adulthood (e.g., 15–17 vs. 30+: adjusted p < .001; 18–20 vs. 30+: adjusted p < .001), whereas comparisons among adjacent adolescent/emerging-adult groups were not distinguishable after correction (e.g., 15–17 vs. 18–20: adjusted p = 1.00).

Survey-weighted logistic models told the same story in effect-size terms. Using **15–17** as the reference, odds of solo theft were higher in adulthood (21–29: **OR = 1.37**, 95% CI [1.10, 1.72], p = .01; 30+: **OR = 1.90**, 95% CI [1.50, 2.41], p < .001), while differences between 18–20 and 15–17 were small (18–20 vs. 15–17: **OR = 1.05**, 95% CI [0.82, 1.34], p = .68). Using **18–20** as the reference, 15–17 remained similar (15–17 vs. 18–20: **OR = 0.95**, 95% CI [0.75, 1.21], p = .68), and adult groups again showed higher odds of solo offending (21–29: **OR = 1.31**, 95% CI [1.08, 1.57], p = .01; 30+: **OR = 1.80**, 95% CI [1.52, 2.14], p < .001).

## Violent incidents

### Descriptive patterns across age groups
In the violent-only scope, the age pattern was similar but more pronounced: group offending constituted **32.0%** (15–17) and **33.2%** (18–20) of violent incidents, compared with **23.5%** in 12–14 and **10.7%** in 30+. Solo violence increased sharply in adulthood (21–29: **59.0%**; 30+: **65.8%**), while observed violence was highest in early adolescence (12–14: **33.5%**).

### Design-based tests and logistic regression
A design-based omnibus test indicated age differences in violent-incident social context (Rao–Scott adjusted **F = 83.88**, df = 4.46, p < .001). Pairwise contrasts again showed especially strong differences between 30+ and younger groups (all adjusted ps < .001), while 15–17 and 18–20 were not distinguishable after correction (adjusted p = 1.00).

In survey-weighted logistic models with **15–17** as the reference category, odds of solo offending were substantially higher in adulthood (21–29: **OR = 1.99**, 95% CI [1.64, 2.40], p < .001; 30+: **OR = 2.65**, 95% CI [2.20, 3.20], p < .001), whereas 18–20 was similar to 15–17 (18–20 vs. 15–17: **OR = 1.20**, 95% CI [0.97, 1.49], p = .09). With **18–20** as the reference, 15–17 again showed similar odds (15–17 vs. 18–20: **OR = 0.83**, 95% CI [0.67, 1.03], p = .09), while adult groups had higher odds (21–29: **OR = 1.65**, 95% CI [1.42, 1.92], p < .001; 30+: **OR = 2.20**, 95% CI [1.88, 2.59], p < .001).

## Backup analysis: total incidents with “social = co-offending only”

When “social” was defined strictly as co-offending (group) rather than including the observed category, the substantive age pattern persisted. Under this backup definition, group offending was highest in **15–17 (31.78%)** and **18–20 (32.41%)**, intermediate in **Under 12 (27.14%)** and **12–14 (24.72%)**, and lowest in adulthood (21–29: **20.21%**; 30+: **12.05%**). This robustness check indicates that the adolescent/emerging-adult elevation in group offending is not an artifact of classifying observation/witnessing as “social.”

## Supplemental (unweighted) robustness checks

Unweighted supplemental analyses (standard chi-square tests and standard logistic regressions) were consistent with the primary weighted analyses in the **direction and overall pattern** of results across total, theft, violent, and the backup operationalization. Because the unweighted analytic sample is already large, these supplemental results underscore that the substantive conclusions are not dependent on the weighting/replicate-weight framework and that interpretation should remain centered on effect magnitudes and interval estimates rather than statistical significance alone.
