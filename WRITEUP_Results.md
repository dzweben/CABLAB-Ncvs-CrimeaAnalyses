## Total incidents (primary definition: solo vs. social; social = co-offending + observed)

### Descriptive patterns across age groups
Across the total incident sample, the proportion of incidents classified as **social** (co-offending + observed) varied meaningfully by age group. Social incidents were most common in the youngest and adolescent age ranges and remained elevated into early emerging adulthood (e.g., Under 12: **52.4%**; 12–14: **57.1%**; 15–17: **57.3%**; 18–20: **53.6%**), before declining in adulthood (21–29: **42.7%**; 30+: **35.3%**). Conversely, the proportion categorized as **solo** increased steadily from adolescence into adulthood (e.g., 15–17: **42.7%**; 18–20: **46.4%**; 21–29: **57.3%**; 30+: **64.7%**).

Within the social category, **co-offending** constituted roughly one-third of incidents in adolescence and early emerging adulthood (15–17: **32.6%**; 18–20: **33.2%**) and declined in adulthood (21–29: **21.1%**; 30+: **12.0%**), whereas the **observed** component varied across age (e.g., 12–14: **32.2%**; 18–20: **20.4%**; 30+: **23.2%**).

### Design-based tests and pairwise comparisons
Figure 1 summarizes the descriptive pattern for the primary operationalization (social = co-offending + observed). A design-based omnibus test confirmed that age group was associated with the solo-versus-social distribution (Rao–Scott adjusted **F**(4.50) = **108.08**, p < .001).

Because there are many pairwise comparisons across six age groups, we do not narrate every test. Instead, we emphasize the comparisons that directly speak to the developmental question and interpret them in effect-size terms (percentage-point differences), using Bonferroni-adjusted p-values across the 15 pairwise tests (Appendix C, Table C1).

- **Adjacency check (15–17 vs. 18–20):** the solo/social distribution was statistically indistinguishable after correction (**F** = 0.09, adjusted p = 1.00), consistent with very similar social involvement (57.3% vs. 53.6%; **Δsocial = 3.7 percentage points**).
- **Teen vs. adult contrast (15–17 vs. 21–29):** 15–17 showed a substantially higher social proportion (**F** = 61.14, adjusted p < .001). In concrete terms, that is **14.6 more social incidents per 100** in 15–17 than 21–29 (57.3% vs. 42.7%).
- **Teen vs. older adult contrast (15–17 vs. 30+):** the gap was even larger (**F** = 235.19, adjusted p < .001): **22.0 more social incidents per 100** in 15–17 than 30+ (57.3% vs. 35.3%).

### Logistic regression: likelihood of solo offending
Survey-weighted logistic regression models further quantified the magnitude of age differences in solo offending. Using **15–17** as the reference category, odds of solo offending were higher for adults (21–29: **OR = 1.80**, 95% CI [1.56, 2.08], p < .001; 30+: **OR = 2.46**, 95% CI [2.11, 2.87], p < .001), whereas differences between adjacent adolescent/emerging-adult categories were comparatively small (18–20 vs. 15–17: **OR = 1.16**, 95% CI [0.98, 1.37], p = .08).

Using **18–20** as the reference category, 15–17 did not differ meaningfully in the odds of solo offending (15–17 vs. 18–20: **OR = 0.86**, 95% CI [0.73, 1.02], p = .08), whereas adult groups again showed substantially higher odds (21–29: **OR = 1.55**, 95% CI [1.38, 1.74], p < .001; 30+: **OR = 2.12**, 95% CI [1.87, 2.40], p < .001).

Notably, the 18–20 and 15–17 comparisons were similar in magnitude and not statistically distinguishable at α = .05 in these models (both ps = .08), consistent with the descriptive pattern that social context peaks in mid-adolescence and remains elevated into ages 18–20 before declining in older adulthood.

## Theft incidents (primary definition: solo vs. social; social = co-offending + observed)

### Descriptive patterns across age groups
In the theft-only scope, the primary contrast of interest was **solo vs. social** theft (social = co-offending + observed). Social theft remained elevated across early adolescence through emerging adulthood (e.g., 12–14: **57.7%**; 15–17: **55.2%**; 18–20: **53.9%**) and declined in adulthood (21–29: **47.3%**; 30+: **39.4%**). Conversely, solo theft increased with age (15–17: **44.8%**; 18–20: **46.1%**; 21–29: **52.7%**; 30+: **60.6%**).

Within the social theft category, co-offending comprised about one-third of theft incidents in adolescence and early emerging adulthood (15–17: **34.3%**; 18–20: **33.2%**) and declined in adulthood (21–29: **24.1%**; 30+: **17.4%**), with the observed component accounting for the remaining social portion.

### Design-based tests and logistic regression
A design-based omnibus test indicated age differences in theft social context (Rao–Scott adjusted **F**(4.59) = **29.00**, p < .001). We again interpret the key comparisons in effect-size terms (percentage-point differences), with Bonferroni correction across 15 pairwise tests (Appendix C, Table C2).

- **Adjacency check (15–17 vs. 18–20):** no meaningful difference after correction (**F** = 0.16, adjusted p = 1.00), consistent with nearly identical social theft (55.2% vs. 53.9%; **Δsocial = 1.3 percentage points**).
- **Teen vs. adult contrast (15–17 vs. 21–29):** teens had higher social theft (**F** = 24.04, adjusted p < .001): **7.9 more social theft incidents per 100** in 15–17 than 21–29 (55.2% vs. 47.3%).
- **Teen vs. older adult contrast (15–17 vs. 30+):** the gap was larger (**F** = 80.87, adjusted p < .001): **15.8 more social theft incidents per 100** in 15–17 than 30+ (55.2% vs. 39.4%).

Survey-weighted logistic models told the same story in effect-size terms. Using **15–17** as the reference, odds of solo theft were higher in adulthood (21–29: **OR = 1.37**, 95% CI [1.10, 1.72], p = .01; 30+: **OR = 1.90**, 95% CI [1.50, 2.41], p < .001), while differences between 18–20 and 15–17 were small (18–20 vs. 15–17: **OR = 1.05**, 95% CI [0.82, 1.34], p = .68). Using **18–20** as the reference, 15–17 remained similar (15–17 vs. 18–20: **OR = 0.95**, 95% CI [0.75, 1.21], p = .68), and adult groups again showed higher odds of solo offending (21–29: **OR = 1.31**, 95% CI [1.08, 1.57], p = .01; 30+: **OR = 1.80**, 95% CI [1.52, 2.14], p < .001).

## Violent incidents (primary definition: solo vs. social; social = co-offending + observed)

### Descriptive patterns across age groups
In the violent-only scope, the primary contrast of interest was **solo vs. social** violence (social = co-offending + observed). Social violence remained high across early adolescence through emerging adulthood (e.g., Under 12: **52.7%**; 12–14: **56.9%**; 15–17: **58.0%**; 18–20: **53.4%**) and then declined sharply in adulthood (21–29: **40.9%**; 30+: **34.2%**). Conversely, solo violence increased sharply in adulthood (21–29: **59.0%**; 30+: **65.8%**).

Within the social violence category, co-offending accounted for about one-third of violent incidents in mid-adolescence and emerging adulthood (15–17: **32.0%**; 18–20: **33.2%**) and was lower in early adolescence (12–14: **23.5%**) and older adulthood (30+: **10.7%**). The observed component was especially prominent in early adolescence (12–14: **33.5%**).

### Design-based tests and logistic regression
A design-based omnibus test indicated age differences in violent-incident social context (Rao–Scott adjusted **F**(4.46) = **83.88**, p < .001). As above, we focus on interpretable contrasts, using Bonferroni-adjusted p-values across the 15 pairwise tests (Appendix C, Table C3).

- **Adjacency check (15–17 vs. 18–20):** no meaningful difference after correction (**F** = 0.25, adjusted p = 1.00), consistent with similar social violence (58.0% vs. 53.4%; **Δsocial = 4.6 percentage points**).
- **Teen vs. adult contrast (15–17 vs. 21–29):** teens had higher social violence (**F** = 43.38, adjusted p < .001): **17.0 more social violent incidents per 100** in 15–17 than 21–29 (58.0% vs. 41.0%).
- **Teen vs. older adult contrast (15–17 vs. 30+):** the gap was largest (**F** = 166.69, adjusted p < .001): **23.8 more social violent incidents per 100** in 15–17 than 30+ (58.0% vs. 34.2%).

In survey-weighted logistic models with **15–17** as the reference category, odds of solo offending were substantially higher in adulthood (21–29: **OR = 1.99**, 95% CI [1.64, 2.40], p < .001; 30+: **OR = 2.65**, 95% CI [2.20, 3.20], p < .001), whereas 18–20 was similar to 15–17 (18–20 vs. 15–17: **OR = 1.20**, 95% CI [0.97, 1.49], p = .09). With **18–20** as the reference, 15–17 again showed similar odds (15–17 vs. 18–20: **OR = 0.83**, 95% CI [0.67, 1.03], p = .09), while adult groups had higher odds (21–29: **OR = 1.65**, 95% CI [1.42, 1.92], p < .001; 30+: **OR = 2.20**, 95% CI [1.88, 2.59], p < .001).

## Backup analysis (co-offending only)

### Descriptive patterns
In a backup operationalization, we defined the social component strictly as **co-offending** (that is, we removed the observed category and treated all non-co-offending incidents as solo). Under this co-offending-only definition, co-offending was highest in **15–17 (31.78%)** and **18–20 (32.41%)**, intermediate in **Under 12 (27.14%)** and **12–14 (24.72%)**, and lowest in adulthood (21–29: **20.21%**; 30+: **12.05%**).

### Design-based test and logistic regression
A design-based omnibus test indicated that age group was associated with the co-offending-versus-solo distribution under this backup operationalization (Rao–Scott adjusted **F**(4.47) = **99.10**, p < .001).

In survey-weighted logistic models using **15–17** as the reference category, **18–20** again showed very similar odds of solo offending (18–20 vs. 15–17: **OR = 0.97**, 95% CI [0.82, 1.16], p = .74), whereas adult groups had substantially higher odds of solo offending (21–29: **OR = 1.84**, 95% CI [1.58, 2.13], p < .001; 30+: **OR = 3.40**, 95% CI [2.88, 4.02], p < .001). Using **18–20** as the reference category, 15–17 remained similar (15–17 vs. 18–20: **OR = 1.03**, 95% CI [0.87, 1.22], p = .74), while adult groups again had higher odds (21–29: **OR = 1.89**, 95% CI [1.61, 2.23], p < .001; 30+: **OR = 3.50**, 95% CI [3.02, 4.05], p < .001).

Together, these results indicate that the adolescent/emerging-adult elevation in co-offending is not an artifact of classifying observation/witnessing as part of the primary social-crime definition.

## Supplemental (unweighted) robustness checks

Unweighted supplemental analyses (standard chi-square tests and standard logistic regressions) were consistent with the primary weighted analyses in the **direction and overall pattern** of results across total, theft, violent, and the backup operationalization. Because the unweighted analytic sample is already large, these supplemental results underscore that the substantive conclusions are not dependent on the weighting/replicate-weight framework and that interpretation should remain centered on effect magnitudes and interval estimates rather than statistical significance alone. Full unweighted outputs are saved as bundled tables for each scope in `supplemental/unweighted_outputs/` (one `*_SUPPLEMENT_unweighted.docx` per scope).
