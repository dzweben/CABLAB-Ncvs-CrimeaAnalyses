# Exemplar papers (reporting conventions)

These papers are included to inform wording and reporting conventions (e.g., **OR/aOR + 95% CI + p-values**; weighted prevalence language) used in `WRITEUP_Methods.md` and `WRITEUP_Results.md`. They are *not* the substantive basis for the NCVS hypotheses.

## Included PDFs

1) **Zhang et al. (2025)** — *BMC Nutrition* (NHANES; weighted logistic regression)
- PDF: `BMC_Nutrition_2025_DII_sleep_disorders.pdf`
- Useful phrasing example (Abstract): “After adjusting … using weighted logistic regression … (OR = 1.057, 95% CI: 1.012–1.105)”

2) **Zhai et al. (2025)** — *General Psychiatry* (BMJ)
- PDF: `BMJ_GenPsych_2025_e102124.pdf`
- Useful phrasing example (Abstract): “(aOR 2.21; 95% CI 2.07 to 2.36; p<0.001)”

## How we use these
- Match the compact, standard Results style: effect estimate + CI (and p-value) in the same sentence.
- Keep interpretation anchored in magnitude/precision rather than significance alone.
- These are cited in `WRITEUP_Methods.md` / `WRITEUP_References.md` as examples of reporting conventions.
