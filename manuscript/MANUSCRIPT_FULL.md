## Data source and study period
Data were drawn from the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) and aggregated across survey years 2014–2022. The NCVS is a nationally representative, stratified multistage household survey administered by the U.S. Census Bureau for the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) that captures criminal victimization experiences, including incidents that may not be reported to police (Bureau of Justice Statistics, 2024).

## Unit of analysis and analytic samples
The unit of analysis for the present study was the incident. Incidents were classified into four analytic scopes: (a) **Total** (all incidents in the merged 2014–2022 analytic file), (b) **Theft**, (c) **Violent**, and (d) a **Total backup definition** used to evaluate robustness under an alternative operationalization of “social” offending (described below). For each scope, incidents were assigned to an offender age group based on the scoring rules implemented in the project notebooks: solo incidents were assigned the solo offender’s age, and group incidents were duplicated and attributed to the youngest and oldest co-offender age brackets to preserve the intended “range” representation (see `total/weighted/*.Rmd` data-prep chunks; artifacts in `total/weighted/*R_Tables/`).

Age group categories were: **Under 12**, **12–14**, **15–17**, **18–20**, **21–29**, and **30+**.

## Measures
### Social context of the incident (primary definition)
The primary social-context measure categorized incidents as **alone**, **group**, or **observed** (i.e., a third category reflecting being observed/witnessed rather than co-offending). This trichotomous measure corresponds to the `social_crime` variable present in the merged incident-level analytic files used by the weighted pipelines and is summarized in the manuscript-facing outputs (e.g., `total/weighted/R_Tables/combinedco-ncvs_percentages_table.docx`).

### Social context of the incident (backup definition: “co-offending only”)
To evaluate whether the substantive pattern of results depended on treating observation/witnessing as “social,” we conducted a total-sample backup analysis in which **social offending was defined strictly as co-offending**. In this backup definition, incidents were categorized as **group** (co-offending) versus **alone** (solo). Weighted backup results are generated by `total/weighted/weighted-ncvs_cooffendingonly_scoring.Rmd` and written to `total/weighted/R_Tables_backup/`.

## Statistical approach

### Weighted, design-based inference (primary analyses)
Primary inferential analyses used NCVS incident weights and replicate weights to obtain design-consistent point estimates and variance estimates. Replicate-weight survey designs were created using **Fay’s balanced repeated replication (BRR)** with **160 replicate weights** (`VICREPWGT1`–`VICREPWGT160`) and Fay’s coefficient **\(\rho = .30\)**. This approach aligns with NCVS documentation describing variance estimation options and the incident-/person-/household-level file structure used for official estimates (Couzens et al., 2014; Shook-Sa et al., 2014; Bureau of Justice Statistics, 2024). All survey-weighted models were implemented in R using the `survey` package via `svrepdesign(..., type = "Fay", rho = 0.3, mse = TRUE)`.

For categorical comparisons across age groups, we conducted survey-weighted Rao–Scott adjusted tests (reported as **F** statistics) and followed omnibus tests with Bonferroni-corrected pairwise comparisons for familywise error control. For modeling the likelihood of solo offending, we fit survey-weighted logistic regression models (`svyglm(..., family = binomial())`) and reported **odds ratios (ORs)** with **95% confidence intervals**.

To directly evaluate whether ages **18–20** more closely resembled adjacent adolescent (**15–17**) versus older adult groups, we fit models using two reference categories: **15–17** and **18–20**.

**Primary analysis entrypoints and artifacts.** Weighted results were generated by the three manuscript-facing notebooks:
- TOTAL: `total/weighted/weighted-ncvs_coofensecombined_scoring.Rmd` → outputs in `total/weighted/R_Tables/`
- THEFT: `total/weighted/theft-weighted-ncvs_coofensecombined_scoring.Rmd` → outputs in `total/weighted/Theft_R_Tables/`
- VIOLENT: `total/weighted/violent-weighted-ncvs_coofensecombined_scoring.Rmd` → outputs in `total/weighted/Violent_R_Tables/`

### Backup definition (weighted; “social = co-offending only”)
A total-sample backup analysis was conducted using a two-category social-context variable (group vs. alone) to evaluate robustness under a “co-offending only” definition of social offending (`total/weighted/weighted-ncvs_cooffendingonly_scoring.Rmd` → `total/weighted/R_Tables_backup/`).

### Unweighted robustness checks (supplemental analyses)
As a supplemental robustness check, we reran descriptives and inferential tests **without weights** (standard chi-square tests and standard logistic regression) for total, theft, violent, and the backup definition using a single runner script (`supplemental/unweighted_run_all.R` → `supplemental/unweighted_outputs/`). These analyses were intended to assess whether the direction and general pattern of results were consistent when analyses were conducted on the raw analytic sample.

## Reporting strategy
Results are reported with an emphasis on **effect magnitudes** (e.g., differences in proportions across age groups and ORs with 95% confidence intervals) alongside inferential statistics. This emphasis is necessary in **large-sample settings** (including the unweighted analytic sample), where high precision can yield small p-values even for modest differences; accordingly, statistical significance is interpreted in the context of magnitude and interval estimates rather than treated as the primary indicator of substantive importance. Consistent with common practice in weighted logistic regression reporting, we present ORs with 95% CIs and p-values in-line with effect estimates (e.g., Zhang et al., 2025; Zhai et al., 2025), while anchoring interpretation in the magnitude and precision of estimates.

# Results

## Total incidents (primary definition: alone vs. group vs. observed)

### Descriptive patterns across age groups
Across the total incident sample, the distribution of incident social context varied meaningfully by age group. In the adolescent and emerging-adult ranges, **group offending constituted roughly one-third of incidents** (15–17: **32.6%**; 18–20: **33.2%**), whereas it was lower in early adolescence (12–14: **24.8%**) and declined further in adulthood (21–29: **21.1%**; 30+: **12.0%**). Conversely, the proportion of incidents categorized as **alone** increased steadily from adolescence into adulthood (e.g., 15–17: **42.7%**; 18–20: **46.4%**; 21–29: **57.3%**; 30+: **64.7%**). The **observed** category varied across age (e.g., 12–14: **32.2%**; 18–20: **20.4%**; 30+: **23.2%**).

### Rao–Scott test and planned pairwise comparisons
A survey-weighted omnibus test indicated that age group was associated with the solo-versus-social distribution (Rao–Scott adjusted **F**(4.50) = **108.08**, p < .001). Descriptively, the percent of incidents classified as social (co-offending + observed) was high across youth groups—Under 12 = **52.4%**, 12–14 = **57.1%**, 15–17 = **57.3%**, and 18–20 = **53.6%**—and lower in adulthood (21–29 = **42.7%**, 30+ = **35.3%**). Relative to ages 30+, the youth groups differed by **+17.1 to +22.0 percentage points** in social involvement; relative to ages 21–29, the youth groups differed by **+9.7 to +14.6 points**.

Planned Bonferroni-adjusted pairwise comparisons (15 pairwise tests total; Appendix C, Table C1) were consistent with this pattern. For 15–17 vs. 18–20, the pairwise test was not statistically significant after correction (adjusted p = 1.00; **Δ = 3.7 points**). In contrast, teen–adult comparisons were statistically significant after correction (15–17 vs. 21–29: adjusted p < .001; **Δ = 14.6 points**; 15–17 vs. 30+: adjusted p < .001; **Δ = 22.0 points**).

### Logistic regression: likelihood of solo offending
Survey-weighted logistic regression models further quantified the magnitude of age differences in solo offending. Using **15–17** as the reference category, odds of solo offending were higher for adults (21–29: **OR = 1.80**, 95% CI [1.56, 2.08], p < .001; 30+: **OR = 2.46**, 95% CI [2.11, 2.87], p < .001), whereas differences between adjacent adolescent/emerging-adult categories were comparatively small (18–20 vs. 15–17: **OR = 1.16**, 95% CI [0.98, 1.37], p = .08).

Using **18–20** as the reference category, 15–17 did not differ meaningfully in the odds of solo offending (15–17 vs. 18–20: **OR = 0.86**, 95% CI [0.73, 1.02], p = .08), whereas adult groups again showed substantially higher odds (21–29: **OR = 1.55**, 95% CI [1.38, 1.74], p < .001; 30+: **OR = 2.12**, 95% CI [1.87, 2.40], p < .001).

Notably, the 18–20 and 15–17 comparisons were similar in magnitude and not statistically distinguishable at α = .05 in these models (both ps = .08), consistent with the descriptive pattern that group offending peaks in mid-adolescence and remains elevated into ages 18–20 before declining in older adulthood.

## Theft incidents

### Descriptive patterns across age groups
In the theft-only scope, group offending again peaked in adolescence and early emerging adulthood, with group incidents comprising **34.3%** (15–17) and **33.2%** (18–20) of theft incidents. Group offending declined in adulthood (21–29: **24.1%**; 30+: **17.4%**), whereas solo theft increased with age (15–17: **44.8%**; 18–20: **46.1%**; 21–29: **52.7%**; 30+: **60.6%**).

### Rao–Scott test and planned pairwise comparisons
A survey-weighted omnibus test indicated age differences in theft social context (Rao–Scott adjusted **F**(4.59) = **29.00**, p < .001). Descriptively, social theft (co-offending + observed) was higher in youth groups (Under 12 = **51.8%**, 12–14 = **57.7%**, 15–17 = **55.2%**, 18–20 = **53.9%**) than in adulthood (21–29 = **47.3%**, 30+ = **39.4%**). Relative to ages 30+, youth–adult differences ranged from **+12.4 to +18.3 percentage points**.

Planned Bonferroni-adjusted pairwise comparisons (15 total; Appendix C, Table C2) were consistent with these descriptives. The 15–17 vs. 18–20 comparison was not statistically significant after correction (adjusted p = 1.00; **Δ = 1.3 points**). Teen–adult comparisons were statistically significant after correction (15–17 vs. 21–29: adjusted p < .001; **Δ = 7.9 points**; 15–17 vs. 30+: adjusted p < .001; **Δ = 15.8 points**).

Survey-weighted logistic models told the same story in effect-size terms. Using **15–17** as the reference, odds of solo theft were higher in adulthood (21–29: **OR = 1.37**, 95% CI [1.10, 1.72], p = .01; 30+: **OR = 1.90**, 95% CI [1.50, 2.41], p < .001), while differences between 18–20 and 15–17 were small (18–20 vs. 15–17: **OR = 1.05**, 95% CI [0.82, 1.34], p = .68). Using **18–20** as the reference, 15–17 remained similar (15–17 vs. 18–20: **OR = 0.95**, 95% CI [0.75, 1.21], p = .68), and adult groups again showed higher odds of solo offending (21–29: **OR = 1.31**, 95% CI [1.08, 1.57], p = .01; 30+: **OR = 1.80**, 95% CI [1.52, 2.14], p < .001).

## Violent incidents

### Descriptive patterns across age groups
In the violent-only scope, the age pattern was similar but more pronounced: group offending constituted **32.0%** (15–17) and **33.2%** (18–20) of violent incidents, compared with **23.5%** in 12–14 and **10.7%** in 30+. Solo violence increased sharply in adulthood (21–29: **59.0%**; 30+: **65.8%**), while observed violence was highest in early adolescence (12–14: **33.5%**).

### Rao–Scott test and planned pairwise comparisons
A survey-weighted omnibus test indicated age differences in violent-incident social context (Rao–Scott adjusted **F**(4.46) = **83.88**, p < .001). Descriptively, social violence (co-offending + observed) was higher in youth groups (Under 12 = **52.7%**, 12–14 = **56.9%**, 15–17 = **58.0%**, 18–20 = **53.4%**) than in adulthood (21–29 = **41.0%**, 30+ = **34.2%**). Relative to ages 30+, youth–adult differences ranged from **+18.5 to +23.8 percentage points**.

Planned Bonferroni-adjusted pairwise comparisons (15 total; Appendix C, Table C3) were consistent with these descriptives. The 15–17 vs. 18–20 comparison was not statistically significant after correction (adjusted p = 1.00; **Δ = 4.6 points**), whereas 15–17 vs. 21–29 and 15–17 vs. 30+ were statistically significant after correction (both adjusted ps < .001; **Δ = 17.0** and **23.8 points**, respectively).

In survey-weighted logistic models with **15–17** as the reference category, odds of solo offending were substantially higher in adulthood (21–29: **OR = 1.99**, 95% CI [1.64, 2.40], p < .001; 30+: **OR = 2.65**, 95% CI [2.20, 3.20], p < .001), whereas 18–20 was similar to 15–17 (18–20 vs. 15–17: **OR = 1.20**, 95% CI [0.97, 1.49], p = .09). With **18–20** as the reference, 15–17 again showed similar odds (15–17 vs. 18–20: **OR = 0.83**, 95% CI [0.67, 1.03], p = .09), while adult groups had higher odds (21–29: **OR = 1.65**, 95% CI [1.42, 1.92], p < .001; 30+: **OR = 2.20**, 95% CI [1.88, 2.59], p < .001).

## Backup analysis: total incidents with “social = co-offending only”

### Descriptive patterns
When “social” was defined strictly as co-offending (group) rather than including the observed category, the substantive age pattern persisted. Under this backup definition, group offending was highest in **15–17 (31.78%)** and **18–20 (32.41%)**, intermediate in **Under 12 (27.14%)** and **12–14 (24.72%)**, and lowest in adulthood (21–29: **20.21%**; 30+: **12.05%**).

### Rao–Scott test and logistic regression
A survey-weighted omnibus test indicated that age group was associated with the group-versus-solo distribution under the co-offending-only backup operationalization (Rao–Scott adjusted **F**(4.47) = **99.10**, p < .001). Descriptively, co-offending was highest in 15–17 (**31.78%**) and 18–20 (**32.41%**) and lower in adulthood (21–29 = **20.21%**, 30+ = **12.05%**), corresponding to differences of **+11.6 to +20.4 percentage points** when comparing 15–17/18–20 to adult groups.

In survey-weighted logistic models using **15–17** as the reference category, **18–20** again showed very similar odds of solo offending (18–20 vs. 15–17: **OR = 0.97**, 95% CI [0.82, 1.16], p = .74), whereas adult groups had substantially higher odds of solo offending (21–29: **OR = 1.84**, 95% CI [1.58, 2.13], p < .001; 30+: **OR = 3.40**, 95% CI [2.88, 4.02], p < .001). Using **18–20** as the reference category, 15–17 remained similar (15–17 vs. 18–20: **OR = 1.03**, 95% CI [0.87, 1.22], p = .74), while adult groups again had higher odds (21–29: **OR = 1.89**, 95% CI [1.61, 2.23], p < .001; 30+: **OR = 3.50**, 95% CI [3.02, 4.05], p < .001).

Together, these results indicate that the adolescent/emerging-adult elevation in group offending is not an artifact of classifying observation/witnessing as “social.”

## Supplemental (unweighted) robustness checks

Unweighted supplemental analyses (standard chi-square tests and standard logistic regressions) were consistent with the primary weighted analyses in the **direction and overall pattern** of results across total, theft, violent, and the backup operationalization. Because the unweighted analytic sample is already large, these supplemental results underscore that the substantive conclusions are not dependent on the weighting/replicate-weight framework and that interpretation should remain centered on effect magnitudes and interval estimates rather than statistical significance alone. Full unweighted outputs are saved as bundled tables for each scope in `supplemental/unweighted_outputs/` (one `*_SUPPLEMENT_unweighted.docx` per scope).
