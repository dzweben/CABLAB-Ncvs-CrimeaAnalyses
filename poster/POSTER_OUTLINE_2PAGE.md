## Page 1 — Main story (teen vs adult)

### Title
**Social context of incidents across age: NCVS survey-weighted analyses (2014–2022)**

### Primary research question (headline)
**Are incidents more likely to occur in a social context during adolescence than adulthood?**

**Secondary (small):** Do ages **18–20** resemble teens (**15–17**) or older adults?

### Data + design (tight Methods box)
- **Data:** National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), **2014–2022**.
- **Dataset:** **Incident-level** records (each record = one victimization incident).
- **Scopes:** Total incidents; Theft/property; Violent/nonfatal personal.
- **Social context (primary):** Alone vs **Social**, where **Social = Co-offending + Observed**.
  - Group (co-offending) = multiple offenders.
  - Observed = our derived category for solo incidents with others present who did not help.
- **Inference:** Survey weights + replicate weights (Fay’s BRR). Rao–Scott adjusted tests for categorical comparisons; planned Bonferroni pairwise; survey-weighted logistic regression for odds of solo offending.

### Primary figure (largest visual)
**Total incidents (primary definition): Social (%) by age group**
- Visual should make **Social = Group + Observed** explicit.
- Annotate key points (15–17, 30+) and the **Δ in percentage points**.

### Key results (effect sizes first; poster-friendly)
**Total (primary):** Social(15–17) = **57.3%** vs Social(30+) = **35.3%** → **Δ = +22.0 points**.

**Planned contrasts (Bonferroni):**
- 15–17 vs 18–20: **ns**, Δ = 3.7 points.
- 15–17 vs 21–29: **p < .001**, Δ = 14.6 points.
- 15–17 vs 30+: **p < .001**, Δ = 22.0 points.

**Model-based check (Total):** Odds of solo offending are higher in adulthood vs teens (e.g., 30+ vs 15–17: **OR = 2.46**).

### Interpretation (APA-safe)
- Social-context involvement is higher in adolescence and ages 18–20 than in adulthood.
- Adjacent teen vs 18–20 differences are small relative to teen–adult differences.

## Page 2 — Replication across scopes + robustness

### Replication across scopes (small multiples)
Three compact panels showing **Social (%) by age** for:
- Theft/property
- Violent/nonfatal personal
- (Optional) Total repeated for visual alignment

### Compact “key contrasts” table (poster-efficient)
A small table with rows = scopes; columns = key contrasts.

Example rows:
- Total: 15–17 vs 30+ (Δ points; Bonferroni result)
- Theft: 15–17 vs 30+ (Δ points; Bonferroni result)
- Violent: 15–17 vs 30+ (Δ points; Bonferroni result)

Optional second contrast column:
- 15–17 vs 18–20 (Δ points; ns)

### Co-offending analysis (conventional operationalization)
Small panel:
- Sociality defined as **co-offending only** (group vs alone).
- Show that the adolescent elevation persists under the conventional definition.

### Inference (demoted; not the headline)
One small strip:
- Rao–Scott omnibus p < .001 across scopes.
- Planned Bonferroni pairwise comparisons reported in the key contrasts table.

### Notes / citations area
- Placeholder for BJS + variance estimation documentation citations.
- Funding / lab footer.
